What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?

a .git folder is created to begin logging metadata to reflect the changes to the files
contained in that repository.
Here is a new line. Should suffice for my changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary space to collect the files that you will store in a commit. The working directory and the repository are the source and the destination, respectively for 
the temporary space.

This is another line in my file.
