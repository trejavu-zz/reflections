When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to work with others on a given project, you would want a way for them to store what they've been doing in a centralized
location that is accessible by everyone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If it were to update automatically, it might not pick up the most recent versions of the files that you would need.
If others are still working on their portions of the project but haven't pushed back to the remote, your files will be stale.
Pulling manually gives you the power to determine when the best time would be to update your files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks=clones in GitHub
Clones=Copies of files and commit history from either local to local or GitHub to local
Branches=not copies at all. they are extensions of projects in a new direction.

Use forks in GitHub when making a copy of someone else's repository to explore under your own account (e.g. if they don't want edits to their repository)
Use clones typically to pull projects to your local filesystem to work on them locally.
Use branches when you are making experimental changes that you don't necessarily want to include in the master branch quite yet.
